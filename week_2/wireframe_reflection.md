##What is a wireframe?

A wireframe is a sample sketch/skeleton of what your website will look like. It is typically without color or images. A wireframe gives you an idea as to how your website will look and with correct mesurements for everything inside the sketch.

##What are the benefits of wireframing?

The benefits of wireframing is being able to see a visual sketch/skeleton of your website. Having a wireframe will make it easier to correct/change the way things look on your website before you begin the developing process. It also serves as a visual guide for developers because it will give them a better idea as to what <tags> it will need base on the images. It keeps everyone organize and sync to the same look.

##Did you enjoy wireframing your site?

Yes. I enjoy using Balsamiq wireframing tools. It was very simple and easy to use. However, it was a bit difficult picturing what my site will look like without color or images. It was a great learning experience especially for someone like myself who does not have design background. I will be purchasing the software for future websites that I create. If you find other services that are better than Balsamiq please leave it in the comment section.

##Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?

I kept the same idea I initially started with but maybe in the future when I get more experience I will redesign my entire site again.

##What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?

The questions that I ask myself were how much information do I have to put when wireframing. Is there a point when you end up with to much details in your wireframe and it becomes overwhelming? I did a little research but everywhere I look they have different opinions. I used YouTube videos as a guide to give me an idea as to what is a common convention while wireframing. Based on the information gathered, I decided to get enough details as possible but to act as a user of my site rather than the creator. After I finish that process I will reevaluate it as a creator to see if the user wants too much or everything is relatively normal. If I begin to confuse myself creating the wireframe or I lose site of what I wanted to create it is time to restart again. 

##Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?

I enjoy creating the wireframe using Balsamiq tools. What bothered me the most was finding a good program to create wireframes. I know Balsamiq has a free service if you are a student or working for a non-profit. I submitted an email application for the student portion and waiting to see if they offer me the free version for being a programming student. I will let everyone know if they approve it.
