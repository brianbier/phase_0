<!-- 
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?

It was great listening to my partner’s ideas as to how to approach the problem of creating the site. But it was good to listen because sometimes you can use other html elements to make something better that would work better than your own idea.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?

I did not research much of the information but it was great researching how to create the Copyright symbol. It was great using the Mozilla html validation tool. I found some errors when validating my html code and we were able to pin point where the problems were. All the information that was provided it to go over before the challenge was super helpful. Understanding the use of the table tab was very helpful. Setting up two columns and a row for each list made the lists easier to read and edit for when its time to use css.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)

I did not style anything for the html but I did prepare the html page so I am ready for the CSS portion of this challenge.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?

You cant style anything. It is efficient and easy to display what you want. It’s also helpful in setting up the skeleton of the page.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?

The tricks I have is just making sure I close all the tags except for the image tag. Another trick I learned is how to use the HTML Entities. Also Understanding the use of divs will be helpful for separating work.
