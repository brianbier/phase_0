##Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.

Creating a new repo is great for when you are about to start a project and need to keep your files securely on Github. Now other people/teammates will be able to see your code. This is helpful because others can now collaborate. Clonin s basically creating a copy of that file on your local computer.

#**Instruction for Beginners **

 ## **Create a new repository**

**Step 1:** Keep Calm because this is super easy. If you rush through the **steps y** you will struggle.

**Step 2:** First make sure you have a Github account set up, then go to your main profile page.

**Step 4:** To the far right you will see a green button that says **_New_.** Click that button.

**Step 5:** Now you will be on the Create a new repository page and fill in the blanks.

* Create a Repository name should be base on the project name
* Create a small description about this project but it is not necessary, you will have time for that later
* Choose Public because if you set it as Private you will have to pay. **Remember this is Open Source**
* You should leave the |.gitignore| dropdown as none since you don’t want to ignore any files.
* **Licenses** There is a great article on the different types of licenses so please check that when you have a chance [Click here.]( http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/03/a-short-guide-to-open-source-and-similar-licenses/ "License Page") To play it safe you can choose MIT License, which is just giving others permission to reuse the software you created without limitations.

# Describe what open source means.

Open Source means software that is made freely available for everyone and may be redistributed and modified. 
In my Opinion Open source can be good and bad. If software is open source it can grow extremely fast, the quality of the software is very customizable and it will get plenty of attention from other developers. For someone like me who is trying to learn programming it is great thing because I can contribute to software and expand my knowledge. The bad side is there are people out there who are using these software’s in the wrong way and are bypassing licensing rules. Also I believe, if the owner of an open source Software decides to stop maintaining the program it can cause some chaos. 
I believe that if you are trying to earn money from a program you created you are better of keeping your source code private because you will have more control over what is happening to it. 
• Assess the importance of using licenses.
Licenses are important because they allow software to be freely used, modified, and shared. 
This essentially protects the owner of a program to face any legal issues. 
For More information about Licenses go to <http://opensource.org/licenses> below is their definition of what a licenses is:

> “ Open source licenses are licenses that comply with the Open Source Definition — in brief, they allow software to be freely used, modified, and shared. To be approved by the Open >Source Initiative (also known as the OSI), a license must go through the Open Source Initiative's license review process. “


#What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

I was able to get a good grasp of every Release. Every time I understand something I had an “aha” moment. The only concept that I found confusing was in the previous lesson on creating different branches to push to github, merging, and pull request. Now after practice I have a good understanding of the workflow.
