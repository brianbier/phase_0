#1.1 Think About Time

Having the right mindset will help you succeed with any time management technique. There are so many different techniques for time management out there but trying to figure out which is best for you is the hardest part. I created my own technique which is to work for 3 hours during the morning and 3 hours in the evening on code assignments, with an extra 20 minutes for every reflection that I need to complete per assignment. So far that's my strategy and it is working just fine, but hey! It’s only the second day that I’ve been using this technique. I started to notice some flaws and I think there is room for improvement. The Pomodoro technique seems very useful and the most productive of all. I can start using this new method during the 3 hours that I have set aside for assignments. This will help me keep track of how long it takes me to finish a certain task. This will help me during my planning stages on future assignments. Hopefully, it will improve my productivity level.

The tiny habits technique was very unusual, but it makes lots of sense. I already have a behavior that I constantly do without realizing it so by applying a tiny habit after the behavior it would make that tiny habit into a behavior without the stress or force. I am still trying to figure out where I am going to use this technique, but my only idea is to start meditating right after I finish my afternoon meal. I would love to hear your thoughts and suggestions. I think after a good meal your body begins to focus all of its energy into your abdominal area making you feel tire. I think that if I start to meditate, it will distribute some of that energy to other places like calming my brainwaves.

Time Boxing is similar to the Pomodoro method since you have to finish a task at the given time that you had set up for yourself. This idea will come in handy during the Peer Pairing Sessions and the Guided Pairing Session so that time is allocated appropriately. I think Time Boxing will be the most challenging technique to use with your peer unless they are willing to try it. A challenge that I personally think of is trying to allocate the right amount of time for a task when someone like me is a beginner. What if I don’t finish that task within the set time, Will I feel as if I failed? These are questions that I asked myself, but I know that failure is just part of learning and improvement.

#1.2 The Command Line

The shell and bash are both command line interpreters found in your computer and are entirely text based. Bash is just another type of specific command line shell and it stands for Bourne-again shell. The most challenging part of this assignment was figuring out how to use the command Env and what is the necessity in changing environment variables. To my understanding, environment variables are similar to programming variables where you are storing values to allow for programs and task to get the necessary information. Other than those commands, I was able to understand every other command in the crash course. Even though I probably won't be using all the useful commands in my opinion the ones that will come in handy are the following pwd, ls, cd , touch,mkdir, rm, rm –rf, man, cat, less, pushd,  popd, and wildcards. Also other commands that will come in handy is vi since you can quickly edit a file and save it with shift + zz . Finally knowing how to exit (control –z) after calling on a command is important because you can easily get stuck.

Can you remember what each of the following does from the top of your head? Write what each does.

-pwd =will show you where you are located in the terminal, so you don’t get lost.

-ls =will list all the files within that directory

-mv =will move a file from one place to another or completely mv files from one to another eliminating the other

-cd =change directory

-../ =go back a directory

-touch =create a file

-mkdir =make a new directory(folder)

-less =will show you what’s inside a file but show it in sections so its organize not like using cat which displays it all and can be over whelming.

-rmdir =removes the directory

-rm =will remove a file. If there is a folder and tons of unwanted files inside you can use rm –rf to remove it all.

-help =or man is just finding a manual for a specific command to understand what other things the command can do.

 

#1.4 Forking and Cloning

Creating a new repo is good for when you to start a project and need to keep your files securely on Github. Now other teammates may want to fork your project to try and improve your code. This is helpful because others are now collaborating which helps your project grow. You have the option to accept/reject any of their changes. I would recommend forking a repository because it’s the easiest way to contribute to someone else work. When you fork you create a copy of it for yourself and now you can do whatever you want without damaging the original repository. Below are the instructions in creating a new repo, forking a repo, and cloning.

 

 

Instruction To: create new repo.

 

Step 1: Keep Calm because this is super easy. If you rush through the steps you will struggle.

 

Step 2: First make sure you have a Github account set up then go to your profile page.

 

Step 3: On your profile page click the tab that says Repositories.

 

Step 4: To the far right you will see a green button that says New. Click that button.

 

Step 5: Now you will be on the Create a new repository page and fill in the blanks.

Create a Repository name base on the project name
Create a small description about this project but it is not necessary, you will have time for that later
Choose Public because if you set it up as Private you will have to pay.
You should leave the |.gitignore| dropdown as none since you don’t want to ignore any files.
You could leave the license as None but if you want to play it safe you can choose MIT License which is just giving others permission to reuse the software you created and protecting yourself if anything happens it won't be your fault.
Then click the green create repository button and Violà! You are done!
 

Step 6: Go back to your profile page click Repository and you will see your first contribution

 

Instructions To: Fork a repo.

 

Step 1: If you want to fork a repo you must go to some else’s Github page.

 

Step 2: click on the Repository tab and you will get a list of their reports. Click on any of them.

 

Step 3: Now you are in that repository page which looks similar to your repo page. At the top right corner you will need to click on the fork button.

 

Step 4: An alert box will appear asking Where should we fork this repository? Click on your name.

Step 5: Now go to your profile page and you will see the Forked repo on your Repositories Tab.

 

Instructions To: Clone a repo.

 

Step 1: Click inside the Repository that you want to clone to your computer

 

Step 2: In the middle of the screen you will notice an HTTP Link. Copy that link.

 

Step 3: Go into your terminal and first determine where you want to clone you want to clone the repository.

 

Step 4: Now on your terminal type git clone (paste the link here) Do Not use the parenthesis example git clone https://github.com/brianbier/p0-cli-exploration.git (Links to an external site.)

 

Step 5: You will be prompt with instructions to entering your GitHub username and password. Just follow the instructions. Then you will give it a few seconds for everything to transfer down to your machine and now you can work on that repository that you clone.
