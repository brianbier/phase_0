What are these methods doing?
These methods give the instance variables the ability to be displayed and be re-assigned.outside of the class.

How are they modifying or returning the value of instance variables?

They are modifying the variables with the methods that have the equal sign for example: change_my_name=(new_name) is the method that assigns the new value for name.

They are returning the instance variable names with the methods that do not take an argument and they only have the instance name within the method. 
  Example: 
  def what_is_name 
    @name
  end
=end
